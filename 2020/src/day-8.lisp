;; Just a brute force lol
;; I did just realize how to do the second part though

;;     1. Create a graph `G` where the nodes correspond to lines of code and the edges take each
;;     node from the node to the next node which would be executed.

;;     2. Create a copy `G'` of `G`, and for each `jmp`/`nop` instruction in `G` insert an edge to
;;     the node in `G'` which you *would* have gotten to had the opcode been flipped

;;     3. Pathfind from node 0 in `G` to node (number-of-instructions) in `G'`, then back up the
;;     path (in the bfs or whatever, keep track of every node's parent) and simulate the
;;     accumulation stuff
