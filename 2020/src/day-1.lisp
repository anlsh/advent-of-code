  ;; This is just an inefficient implementation of the classic "two sum" problem: inefficient
  ;; because you don't need the hash table at all.
  ;; See https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs9/sample_probs/TwoSum.pdf for the "proper" solution...
  ;;     The reason why it works wasn't immediately obvious to me, but you can prove that it works
  ;;     by showing that if there are n1, n2 such that A[n1] + A[n2] = desired sum, then it is
  ;;     impoosible for i or j to move inside the [n1, n2] range while the other is outside
  ;;
  ;; As an addendum, two-sum with duplicates is easy: just map numbers to the list of indices where
  ;; they appear, two-sum a deduplicated array to get a list of summands, and just go through
  ;; that list and calculate the cartesian product of the relevant indices at each step
