However, because they are timid and stubborn, the amphipods have some extra rules:

    - Amphipods will never stop on the space immediately outside any room. They
    can move into that space so long as they immediately continue moving.
    (Specifically, this refers to the four open spaces in the hallway that are
    directly above an amphipod starting position.)

    - Amphipods will never move from the hallway into a room unless that room is
      their destination room and that room contains no amphipods which do not
      also have that room as their own destination. If an amphipod's starting
      room is not its destination room, it can stay in that room until it leaves
      the room. (For example, an Amber amphipod will not move from the hallway
      into the right three rooms, and will only move into the leftmost room if
      that room is empty or if it only contains other Amber amphipods.)

    - Once an amphipod stops moving in the hallway, it will stay in that spot
      until it can move into a room. (That is, once any amphipod starts moving,
      any other amphipods currently in the hallway are locked in place and will
      not move again until they can move fully into a room.)
